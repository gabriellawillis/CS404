Final: Project 2

Project 2 – Emergency Vehicle Dispatching System
We are trying to design an emergency vehicle dispatching system. 
Let’s assume that there are three different types of emergency vehicles: 1 (Ambulance), 2 (Fire Truck), 3 (Police car). 
Let’s also assume that every request only needs one emergency vehicle.

Implement an algorithm that processes requests one by one. For each request, the algorithm should try to find the closest available emergency vehicle 
Implement the algorithm in a language you are comfortable with.
Make up the data for the project. It should be similar to the examples I gave. You can generate the files at run time, or have it stored in files, and you read it at run time.
